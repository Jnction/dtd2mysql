  Every passenger station in the National Rail network has a CRS code, however, some multi-part stations
  may have additional minor CRS code specifying a part of it. For example,
  STP (London St Pancras) has a minor code SPL representing the Thameslink platforms, while the main code represents the terminal platforms;
  PAD (London Paddington) has a minor code PDX representing the Crossrail platforms, while the main code represents the terminal platforms.

  In the database, such stations will have multiple entries, one for each TIPLOC code, where the one with cate_interchange_status <> 9 is the main entry
  which the CRS code (crs_code) and the minor CRS code (crs_reference_code) are the same.

  Using St Pancras as an example, there are 4 entries listed in the station database:
  TIPLOC    CRS    minor CRS    main entry?   MCT       location
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  STPX      STP    STP          *             15        Midland Main Line platforms
  STPADOM   STP    STP                        15        Domestic High Speed platforms
  STPXBOX   STP    SPL                        15        Thameslink platforms
  STPANCI   SPX    SPX          *             35        International platforms

  In the National Rail systems, the international station is treated as a distinct station from the domestic one,
  however the 3 remaining parts (Midland, Thameslink and High Speed Domestic) are the same station.

  The stop list will return one entry for each station (not its constituent parts) as a GTFS station identified by its main CRS code,
  and one entry for each platform as a GTFS stop identified by its minor CRS code and the platform number, associated to the station with the main CRS code.
